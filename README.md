# MyAgent
This repository is part of my MsC Thesis conducted at TU Delft. It contains the GOAL Agent used in a Dialog System which decouples the cognitive processes from the dialog management tasks. The agent is intended to get some information about the user (young child) and have a pleasant conversation with her.

####Capabilities:
1. Meet the user (know her name)
2. Acquire basic information (gender and age)
3. Acquire advanced information (partner and future job)
4. Converse about advanced information
5. Joke module in case user dislikes current topic
6. Different responses depending on agent mood while acquiring basic information
7. Failure resolution
8. Follow up questions in case user dislikes conversation

To successfully launch the system the EIS interface (https://github.com/sixme/EIS) is required along with the GOAL framework version 1.3.3 (http://goalhub.github.io/eclipse/)
